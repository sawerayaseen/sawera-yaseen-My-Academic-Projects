# Stance Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting the stance (Agree, Disagree, Neutral, or Query) of social media comments in response to specific claims or events. It is built using deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based architectures. This tool is useful for researchers, data scientists, and organizations working in Natural Language Processing (NLP), misinformation analysis, and opinion mining.

## Features

- Multi-class stance detection (Agree, Disagree, Comment, Query)
- Cleaned and labeled dataset for real-world claims
- Models trained: Naive Bayes, LSTM, and BERT
- Performance comparison with accuracy graphs

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on Stance Detection, which is a natural language processing (NLP) task. The goal is to determine whether a given comment or statement agrees, disagrees, discusses, or queries a particular claim or topic. It is especially useful for fake news detection, social media monitoring, and sentiment analysis.


## ✨ Features
Detects stance (agree, disagree, comment, query) from user comments

Supports multiple machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)

Preprocessed and cleaned dataset

Visualizations for result comparison

Easy-to-run Python scripts for training and testing


## 🗂️ Dataset
We used a custom dataset that includes:

Claims: Statements related to trending news or events

User Comments: Public responses to the claims

Labels: Ground truth stance labels (Agree, Disagree, Comment, Query)

The data was collected, preprocessed (stop words removal, tokenization), and split into train/test sets.

## 🧠 Model Details
The project supports:

Naive Bayes Classifier: For probabilistic text classification

Support Vector Machine (SVM): For high-dimensional feature separation

TF-IDF Vectorizer: To convert text into numerical feature vectors
Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
## 📊 Results
The comparison between models is shown below:

Naive Bayes Accuracy: XX%

SVM Accuracy: XX%

Model with highest precision: [CNN]
Charts and graphs are included in the results folder to visualize model performance.

## 🚀 How to Run

## 🔮 Future Work
Integrate deep learning models like LSTM

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Expand the dataset to cover more claims and comments

Include multilingual support
